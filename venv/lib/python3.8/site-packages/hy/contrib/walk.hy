Bindings are processed sequentially,
so you can use the result of an earlier binding in a later one.

Basic assignments (e.g. setv, +=) will update the let binding,
if they use the name of a let binding.

But assignments via `import` are always hoisted to normal Python scope, and
likewise, `defclass` will assign the class to the Python scope,
even if it shares the name of a let binding.

Use `import_module` and `type` (or whatever metaclass) instead,
if you must avoid this hoisting.

Function arguments can shadow let bindings in their body,
as can nested let forms.
